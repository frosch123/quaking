This is about the behaviour of
 - Capacity properties (14 of trains, 0F of road vehicles, 0D of ships, 0F and 11 of aircraft)
 - CB 36 'capacity'
 - CB 15 'refitted capacity'
 - default capacity multipliers when refitting without CB 15
 - default capacity of vehicles when using 'default cargo is first refittable cargo'
in OTTD r15297 and TTDP r2082.


Trains:
  OTTD behaviour:
    Default capacity:
      - As returned by callback 36.
      - If that fails, use the capacity property.
    Refitted capacity:
      - As returned by callback 15.
      - If that fails, use callback 36 and apply capacity multipliers relative to the default cargo.
      - If that fails, use the capacity property and apply capacity multipliers relative to the default cargo.
    Capacity multipliers:
      4 passengers[0] = 2 mail[0] bags = 2 goods[0] boxes = 1 unit other cargo
    Caveats:
      - Callback 15 is not called on construction/in the purchase list.
        So once refitted you cannot return to the original capacity.
      - When using 'default cargo is first refittable cargo' the capacities are undefined and vary depending on
        the capacity multiplier of the first refittable cargo. (which is unknown to the grf when using cargo classes)

  TTDP behaviour:
    Default capacity: As in OTTD.
    Refitted capacity in refit GUI: As in OTTD.
    Refitted capacity after actually refitting:
      - As returned by callback 36 without applying any multipliers.
      - If that fails, use the capacity property and apply capacity multipliers relative to the default cargo.
    Capacity multiplies: As in OTTD.
    Caveats:
      - As in OTTD.
      - CB 15 not working. (at least when CB 36 is also used)
      - CB 36 without multipliers.


Road vehicles:
  OTTD behaviour: As for trains.
  TTDP behaviour:
    As in OTTD, except:
      - no CB 36
      - no capacity multipliers: 1 passenger = 1 mail bag = 1 goods box = 1 unit other cargo


Ships:
  OTTD behaviour:
    As for trains, except:
      - no capacity multipliers: 1 passenger = 1 mail bag = 1 goods box = 1 unit other cargo
  TTDP behaviour: As in OTTD.


Aircraft:
  OTTD behaviour:
    Default capacity, if default cargo is passenger+mail:
      - No CB 36
      - Use unmodified capacity properties.
    Default capacity, if default cargo is not passenger+mail:
      - Use a virtual capacity of 'passenger capacity + mail capacity' and apply the capacity multipliers relative to passengers.
    Refitted capacity if refitting to passengers(+mail):
      - Use CB 15 for passengers
      - If that fails, use the capacity property.
      - Always use the capacity property for mail.
    Refitted capacity if refitting to other cargo:
      - Use CB 15.
      - If that fails, use a virtual capacity of 'passenger capacity + mail capacity' and apply the capacity multipliers relative to passengers.
    Capacity multipliers:
      4 passengers[0] = 4 mail[0] bags = 2 goods[0] boxes = 1 unit other cargo
      (yes, passenger multiplier = mail multiplier)
    Caveats:
      - Different multipliers
      - No CB 36 for passenger and mail capacity.

  TTDP behaviour:
    Default capacity, if default cargo is passenger+mail:
      - No CB 36
      - Use CB 15 for passengers
      - If that fails, use the capacity property.
      - Always use the capacity property for mail.
    Default capacity, if default cargo is not passenger+mail:
      - No CB 36
      - Use CB 15 to replace passenger capacity, if succeeding.
      - Use a virtual capacity of 'passenger capacity + 2 * mail capacity' and apply the capacity multipliers relative to passengers.
    Refitted capacity: As for default capacity.
    Caveats:
      - '2 * mail capacity' is added to the result of callback 15


Unmodified TTD behaviour:
  Trains:
    - Not refittable

  Road vehicles:
    - Not refittable

  Ships:
    - Not refittable to passengers
    - No capacity multipliers

  Aircraft:
    - Not refittable to mail
    - Use only passenger capacity for refitting
    - 4 passengers = 2 goods boxes = 1 unit other cargo


Proposed solution: (partly outdated!)
  - Same method for all vehicles
  - Same method for default cargo and after refitting.
  - Specify vehicle default cargo as translateable 'cargo bit' instead of 'slot'. (only for grf version 8)
  - Capacity multipliers from a newcargo property, instead of fixed slot.
  - Test if a vehicle is refittable:
      - Call CB 36 resp. use property, if that returns 0 the vehicle is not refittable.
      - Do not call CB 15.
  - Capacity:
      - Use CB 15 result without applying any multipliers.
      - If that fails, use CB 36 result and apply capacity multipliers.
      - If that fails, use capacity property and apply capacity multipliers.
  - Planes:
      - If carrying passenger+mail
          - Use CB 15 + 36 for passengers
          - Use CB 36 also for mail
      - If carrying other cargo:
          - If using CB 15 succeeds, ignore mail capacity.
          - In other cases use CB 36 and properties for passenger and mail.
            Refitted capacity is:
              'refit cargo multiplier' * ('passenger capacity' / 'passenger multiplier' + 'mail capacity' / 'mail multiplier')
            Note: The implementation would use the equivalent formula:
              'refit cargo multiplier' * ('passenger capacity' * 'mail multiplier' + 'mail capacity' * 'passenger multiplier') / ('mail multiplier' * 'passenger multiplier')
  - Capacity multiplier:
      - Property of newcargos.
      - Byte ranging from 1 to 255, 0 reserved.
      - Default values:
         Passenger (slot 0): 0x40
         Mail (slot 2): 0x20
         Goods (slot 5): 0x20
         Other: 0x10
      - When using 'default cargo is first refittable cargo type' the capacity property and results of CB36 are those for the 'Other' multiplier 0x10
  - Differences to original TTD (wrt. things that were already possible):
      - Aircraft mail capacity is used when refitting.
      - Ships have doubled capacity when refitted to mail or goods.
  - Differences to current OTTD and TTDP:
      - consistent
      - well defined (esp. for 'default cargo is first refittable cargo')
  - Advantages for grf authors:
      - Can use callback 15 to specify individual capacities for known cargos.
      - Can let callback 15 fail to use the multipliers given in the cargo definiton.
      - CB 36 support for plane capacity including mail.
      - Newcargo definitions can modify the capacity multipliers.
      - Refittable vehicles stay refittable, though they carry currently 0 units. (CB 36 returns != 0, CB 15 return 0)
      - Vehicles are refittable for livery trickery, though they never carry anything. (CB 36 return != 0, CB 15 return always 0)
  - Caveats:
      - The default multipliers in the cargo spec do not depend on the vehicle type.
        (would be possible, if it becomes a callback (of the cargo) somewhen)



[0] Identified by the 'cargo slots'. So maybe a different cargo when using newcargos.
